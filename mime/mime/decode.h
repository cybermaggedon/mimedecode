   \section intro Introduction
 
   This library currently consists of a single feature, capable of decoding
   MIME data.  

   \section mimedecode Decoding MIME

   To use this library to decode MIME data, you need to study the decoder
   class, and the client_interface class.  To do something useful with this
   library, you need to provide a class, which is derived from the decoder
   class.  In deriving the class, you need to implement all the methods in the
   client_interface interface.

   Also, see simple.C on the example page.
